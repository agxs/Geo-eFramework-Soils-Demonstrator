    <h1>GeFC Demonstrator Guide</h1>
    <h2>Quick Guide</h2>
    <p>
      To get started quickly, simple adjust the numbers in the three boxes under
      'Edit Variables' then hit 'Submit Process' right at the bottom. Once the
      processing is complete(the busy icon will disappear) you can click the
      'Result' checkbox in the top panel to display your data. You can also
      download the data to your desktop machine by clicking the new link underneath
      'Submit Process'.
    </p>
    <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Map Content Control</h4>
        <p>
          At the top of left panel is the 'Map Content Control'. This allows you
          to toggle on and off the various datasets that the application uses. Three
          datasets are available for preview, Rainfall, Landcover and Erosion Coefficients.
          These three datasets never change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two checkboxes are greyed out when first visiting the application,
          'Landcover Preview' and 'Result'. These are enabled when 'Preview Grow'
          and 'Submit Process' are clicked. They are both dynamically calculated
          datasets.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Legend</h4>
        <p>
          This panel describes what the various colours of the datasets represent.
          Rainfall is measured in millimetres per year and the Erosion Coefficients
          and results are measured in tons per square kilometre per year per
          millimetre squared of rainfall.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result representation is split into two gradients. Yellow to red
          is defined as a 'low' level of erosion where as dark red to light red
          is defined as a 'high' level of erosion.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Edit Variables</h4>
        <p>
          The three boxes provided in this panel allow the models parameters to
          be customised. 'Rainfall Exponent' the value that the rainfall value
          is raised to the power of. Valid ranges of this are between 1.5 and 2.5.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Stream Connectivity' represents how much erosion is carried away by the
          countries stream network. This is a linear value and valid numbers are
          between 0 representing nothing is carried away and 1 representing 
          everything is carried away.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Grow Factor' is used to grow or shrink the about of woody/forest areas
          that are in the 'Landcover' dataset. The values are in metres and they
          will grow or shrink the discrete forest areas by that amount. Negative
          values represent deforestation and positive values represent extra
          forest growth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Preview grow</h4>
        <p>
          This button processed the 'Landcover' dataset and will increase or
          decrease the amount of forest area by the specified number of metres.
          Clicking this activates the 'Landcover Preview' checkbox in the 'Map
          Content Control' panel.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Data Coverages</h4>
        <p>
          These three WCS URLs are used to configure the input datasets used
          when calculating the result of the model. These must point to WCS 1.0
          servers and the format requested must be a GeoTIFF. Any &amp; symbol
          (such as between parameters) must be URL escaped to look like &amp;amp;.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>
          The 'Submit Process' button will run the soil erosion model and create
          a preview map overlay which can be viewed by clicking on the newly
          enabled 'Result' checkbox in the top panel. If parameters are adjusted
          and the submit button is pressed for a second time, the map will
          automatically updated to draw the new result.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Download</h4>
        <p>
          Once the 'Submit Process' operation is complete a download link appears
          underneath the button. Using this you can download the raw result to
          load into a GIS application for further processing or analysis. Any
          application used to read this file must support reading GeoTIFF images
          using 32-bits per channel with floating point numbers as the data type.
